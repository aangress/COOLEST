# Definitions of mass and light profiles

In order to bring together different modeling codes and ensure models are consistent with others, a necessary part of COOLEST is the definition of a set of mass and light profile parametrizations.

The different profiles are split into two broad categories:

- [mass profiles](https://coolest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/model_profiles/mass.html) to describe lens potentials, surface mass densities and other lensing-related quantities;
- [light profiles](https://coolest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/model_profiles/mass.html) to describe surface brightness distributions, including extended (galaxies) or point-like (stars, quasars) objects.
