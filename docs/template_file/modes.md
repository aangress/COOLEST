# The different template "modes"

The JSON template at the core of the standard is not limited to store best-fit parameters of a lens model. Another practical use of COOLEST is to _create_ a lens model and define related parameter values to generate new mock data. The difference with a lens model is that the template file would not contain prior or posterior distribution information, but only (point estimate) values for each model parameter. Another different is that there should not be any data file contained in the COOLEST directory, as it will be generated by the simulator code based on the content of the template.

The `'mode'` section of the JSON file informs about the usage of the template. Currently there is three modes:

- `'MAP'`: if the template is for storing maximum _a posteriori_ (MAP) parameter values, optionally alongside prior distribution information and statistics regarding posterior distributions.

- `'MOCK'`: if the template is meant to describe a simulated strong lens system, to be used with a given simulator code.

- `'DOC'`: if the template should contains fields that give additional information about each JSON section (only useful for developing documentation or understanding the hierarchical structure of the file).

``` {admonition} Note
An additional fourth mode is planned, focused on an efficient storage of full posterior sampling chains.
